# table_to_text
Little script that prints out a text representation of an excel table. Useful for comment blocks when writing code, and you have to reference a table.

Put your excel file in the "input" directory. Make sure that there is only one file in that directory, or program will throw error.

Run program. Should print out text representation of the table in ./input/"
